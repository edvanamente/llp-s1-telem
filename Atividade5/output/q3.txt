You're Losing Me
Taylor Swift

You say: I don't understand, and I say: I know you don't
We thought a cure would come through in time, now, I fear it won't
Remember looking at this room, we loved it 'cause of the light
Now I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time

Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?
I'm getting tired, even for a phoenix
Always rising from the ashes
Mending all her gashes
You might just have dealt the final blow

Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore
For you
'Cause you're losing me

Every morning, I glared at you with storms in my eyes
How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dying?
I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick
My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick

And the air is thick with loss and indecision
I know my pain is such an imposition
Now, you're running down the hallway
And you know what they all say
You don't know what you got until it's gone

Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore
For you
'Cause you're losing me
'Cause you're losing me
Stop (stop)
'Cause you're losing me

My heart won't start anymore (stop, 'cause you're losing me)
My heart won't start anymore (stop, 'cause you're losing me)

How long could we be a sad song?
Till we were too far gone to bring back to life?
I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy
And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier

Fighting in only your army, frontlines, don't you ignore me
I'm the best thing at this party (you're losing me)
And I wouldn't marry me either
A pathological people pleaser
Who only wanted you to see her
And I'm fading, thinking

Do something, babe, say something (say something)
Lose something, babe, risk something (you're losing me)
Choose something, babe, I got nothing (I got nothing)
To believe, unless you're choosing me

You're losing me
Stop (stop, stop), you're losing me
Stop (stop, stop), you're losing me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore
